# tri-timekeeper

- Create new race, generates a simple tag for adding times + guid for admin edit
- Register users (name + number + group)
- Admin: Start group (e.g. add first timestamp for all users in group)
- All: Add time stamp (choose name of position e.g. T1, "By the trashcans" etc, then add UTC time ) a position needs to have a threshold timestamp. E.g. all double entries within the threshold will be concidered the same entry and only the first will count. So multiple timekeepers can stand at the same position and register all users.
- See times in table format
- Admin: Export to google spreadsheet, excel, csv etc.
